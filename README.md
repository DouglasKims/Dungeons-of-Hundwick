# Dungeons of Hundwick
 
A simple Dungeon Crawler game made using Python and Ren'Py. It's heavily based on the Etrian Odyssey series for the Nintendo DS. Featuring Dungeon-Crawling, Exploration, and Difficult combat.

This is a working demo, with some features missing, but the basics of exploration and combat are all in place.
